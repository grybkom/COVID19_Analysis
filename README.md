Linear Models to Explore the Relationship Between Population and COVID19 Cases and Deaths 

The COVID-19 outbreak started in December of 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020 (World Health Organization: WHO, 2024). As of August 2023, The World Health Organization (2023) estimated there were over 760 million cases and 6.9 million deaths recorded worldwide. The virus that causes COVID-19 is most often spread between people in close contact, and avoiding crowds and wearing mask is recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (World Health Organization: WHO, 2023). Since close contact with others has been established as an important factor in the spread of COVID-19, it would be reasonable to assume areas with higher populations would be more adversely impacted by the disease. Here the relationship between population density and COVID-19 cases and deaths will be examined.
